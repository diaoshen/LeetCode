371. Sum of Two Integers
Easy


Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

Example 1:

Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: a = -2, b = 3
Output: 1



/*
	Recursion solution 1 
	
	Solution: 
	
	if b == 0
		return a
	else
		add( a^b , (a&b) << 1 ) 
		
		
	Idea is to compute a XOR b for Result and a AND b for carry.
	shift the carry over and compute XOR again until there is no carry left.
	
*/

/*
	Solution 2 


	public int getSum(int a, int b) {
	   return b == 0 ? a : getSum(a^b , (a&b) << 1);
	}
